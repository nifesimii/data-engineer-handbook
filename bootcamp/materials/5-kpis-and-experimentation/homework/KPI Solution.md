**My iPhone KPI AND EXPERIMENTATION**

I am going to talk about my iPhone Journey: A Tale of Love and Loyalty

**2015: The Beginning of a Journey**

It was in my second year of college. It was really an awesome moment when I got my first iPhone: the iPhone 6. As a young student, I had a device to capture my first moments with lifelong friends and help with school work by helping me take notes I could always access at any time. Almost every app I used on my iPhone felt leagues ahead of anything I had used before, from the camera to the chat and notes app. The iPhone 6 became an indispensable part of my daily life.

**2016: An Upgrade to Brilliance**

A year later, in 2016, I upgraded to the iPhone 6s. While the external design was familiar, the iPhone 6s introduced me to the magic of 3D Touch and the sheer power of its A9 chip. Suddenly, my device felt faster and more responsive. The improved camera with Live Photos added a new dimension to capturing memories, bringing photos to life with a tap. It wasn’t just an upgrade; it enhanced everything I had grown to love about the iPhone.

**2017: The iPhone 7 Era**

In 2017, I took another step forward with the iPhone 7. The boldness of Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack didn’t really bother me once I bought the Lightning to 3.5mm Jack Converter; it was life as usual from then on; the water resistance feature did offer peace of mind. I do remember the matte black finish always felt premium, and it was always tempting to take off the case for a long period. the performance of the device kept up with my growing demands as I made sure to get the 128 GB version this time around

**2018–2023: Holding On to the Legacy**

Despite the rapid advancements in technology and the release of new iPhone models, I found myself sticking with the iPhone 7. It was a reliable companion through my early professional years. While newer iPhones tempted me with their edge-to-edge displays, Face ID, and advanced cameras, the iPhone 7’s performance and familiarity kept me loyal. It wasn’t just a phone; it was a part of my routine, carrying memories of my college days and early career.

**2024: A Leap to the Future**

After seven years, I took the plunge and bought the **iPhone 15 Pro**. This wasn’t just an upgrade; it was a commitment to a new journey in **content creation**. With its incredible camera capabilities and powerful hardware, the iPhone 15 Pro is my go-to tool for creating professional-quality content and interviewing fellow data professionals. It symbolizes the start of an exciting endeavor to share insights and connect with the broader tech community.

**2025: FORWARD ON !!**

Now, with plans to launch this initiative, the iPhone 15 Pro stands as a testament to how technology can empower creativity and storytelling, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me.

**Experiment One: Enabling Payment in Nigerian Local Currency for Apple In-App Purchases**

**Objective**

To test whether partnering with a payment startup or national bank to enable in-house Apple purchases using Nigerian local currency increases in-store purchases.

**Hypotheses**

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:  
    Partnering with the payment company will not increase the number of in-store Apple purchases.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:  
    Partnering with the payment company will increase the number of in-store Apple purchases.

**Metrics**

1. **Leading Metric**:
    - Number of in-store purchases made using the new payment option (via the payment app).
    - This metric reflects the direct adoption and usage of the partnership payment solution.
2. **Lagging Metric**:
    - Total increase in in-store purchases (regardless of payment method).
    - This metric measures the overall impact of the partnership on Apple's revenue from Nigerian customers.

**Experiment Design**

1. **Population Selection**:
    - Nigerian Apple users currently unable to use local cards for Apple in-app purchases.
2. **Test Cell Allocation**:
    - **Control Group (50%)**:
        - Retain the current system without introducing the local payment option.
    - **Test Group (50%)**:
        - Introduce the local payment option integrated via the partnered payment company or national bank.
3. **Duration**:
    - Run the experiment for **8 weeks** to account for variations in purchasing behavior and potential adoption delays.
4. **Randomization**:
    - Randomly assign Nigerian Apple IDs or devices to either the test group or the control group to ensure unbiased results.

**Execution Plan**

1. **Implementation**:
    - Collaborate with the selected payment startup or national bank to integrate local payment options into the Apple App Store and other in-app purchase mechanisms.
    - Ensure a smooth and secure payment process for users in the test group.
2. **Communication**:
    - Notify test group users about the availability of the new payment option through in-app messages, emails, or push notifications.
    - Avoid communicating about this change to the control group to maintain isolation.
3. **Data Collection**:
    - Track transactions made through the new payment option (test group).
    - Compare the total number of in-store purchases between the test and control groups.

**Analysis Plan**

1. **Evaluate Leading Metric**:
    - Compare the number of purchases using the partnered payment app in the test group against the control group (which cannot use this option).
2. **Evaluate Lagging Metric**:
    - Assess whether there is a statistically significant increase in the total number of in-store purchases in the test group compared to the control group.
3. **Statistical Significance**:
    - Use a **t-test** or **chi-square test** (depending on the data distribution) to determine if the differences between the test and control groups are significant.

**Expected Outcome**

- If the null hypothesis is rejected, the experiment demonstrates that enabling local currency payments through a partnership increases Apple purchases in Nigeria, potentially unlocking a new revenue stream.
- If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it may suggest barriers beyond payment options affecting purchasing behavior.
